# Troubleshooting
## There are known issues when installing SOD as DLC for BG:EE
Here is a solution:

* Before "Akun's Gear" is installed(If it is already installed, uninstall it before installing SOD by launching "*Setup-akgear.exe*".):
	1. SOD needs to be installed as BG:EE DLC 
	2. and after that [DLCmerger](https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases) needs to be installed.

Here is my [fast](https://github.com/Incrementis/Akuns-Gear-/blob/main/akgear/Fast_installation_of_DLCmergerEN.pdf) Win64 installation guide for modmerge, but possibly the [official](https://github.com/ScottBrooks/modmerge) installation guide is recommended.
